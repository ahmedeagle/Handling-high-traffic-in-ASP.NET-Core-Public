1- Caching: Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory or on disk to reduce database load and improve response times.

    Tools & Techniques:
    Redis [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/implementation-of-the-redis-cache-in-the-net-core-api/]
    Memcached [https://dotnetcorecentral.com/blog/using-memcached-as-distributed-cache-in-net-core/]
    ASP.NET Core Response Caching Middleware [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/middleware?view=aspnetcore-7.0]
    In-Memory Cache [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/memory?view=aspnetcore-7.0]

2- Load Balancing: Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to improve application performance and availability.

    Tools & Techniques:
    Nginx [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=linux-ubuntu]
    HAProxy [https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/asp-net-core-authentication-in-a-load-balanced-environment-with-haproxy-and-redis]
    Azure Load Balancer [https://winsmarts.com/aspnet-core-azure-ad-authentication-and-load-balancers-e458f5ef54c6]


3- Asynchronous Programming: Asynchronous programming runs multiple tasks concurrently, allowing the application to handle more requests and improve performance.

  Tools & Techniques:
  Task Parallel Library (TPL) [https://hub.packtpub.com/task-parallel-library-multi-threading-net-core/]
  async/await [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/async-scenarios]
  Reactive Extensions (Rx) [https://dotnetcorecentral.com/blog/reactive-extensions-in-net-core/]
  Actor Model [https://samueleresca.net/developing-apis-using-actor-model-in-asp-net/]

4- Message Queues: Message queues decouple tasks and process them asynchronously, improving application performance and scalability during traffic spikes.

  Tools & Techniques:
  RabbitMQ [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/rabbitmq-message-queue-using-net-core-6-web-api/]
  Azure Service Bus [https://damienbod.com/2019/04/23/using-azure-service-bus-queues-with-asp-net-core-services/]
  Google Cloud Pub/Sub [https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/reference/Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1/latest]
  Kafka [https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/dotnet/current/overview.html]
  
5- Profiling and Performance Tuning: Profiling your application and optimizing performance can help you identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

  Tools & Techniques:
  BenchmarkDotNet [https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet]
  JetBrains dotTrace [https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/]
  New Relic [https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/dotnet-core]
